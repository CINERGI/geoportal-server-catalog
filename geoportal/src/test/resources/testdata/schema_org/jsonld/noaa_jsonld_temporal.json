  "name" : "Mariners Weather Log",
  "description" : "The Mariners Weather Log (MWL) is a publication containing articles, news and information about marine weather events and phenomena, worldwide environmental impact concerns, climatology studies, storms at sea, and weather forecasting. The MWL is dedicated to the NWS Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) Program, Port Meteorological Officers (PMOs), cooperating ships officers, and their vessels. Through the various articles, mariners and other interested individuals are kept abreast of the most current operational uses of marine weather and oceanographic data. There are also articles concerning general meteorology and oceanography. The marine weather review included in the magazine contains a smooth log and sometimes a rough log. The smooth log (complete with cyclone tracks, climatological data from U.S. Ocean Weather Station \"Hotel\" and buoys, and gale and wave tables) is a definitive report on normal monthly weather systems, the primary storms that affected marine areas, and ship casualties for recent months. The rough log, when published, is a preliminary account of the weather for recent months that are not covered in the smooth log. Also included in the magazine is a special hurricane section as well as a section dealing with current projects and relevant scientific/meteorological occurrences. The archive holds a subset of these publications.",
